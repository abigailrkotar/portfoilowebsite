             <p> Overall, I really enjoy exploring the intersection of the arts and computer science. My journey as a creator began in my basement, where I would choreograph short dance combinations. I strung together different movements, feeling the music around me. As I got older the music began to shift. As I sat facing a screen, the soundtrack from computer games began to surround me. I found myself immersed in a whole new world of technology and innovation. Soon enough, I was creating Flash games, sketching out an asteroid and coding gameplay mechanics for my own Star Wars-inspired game. This newfound passion for technology intertwined seamlessly with my love for creation, igniting a lifelong curiosity. 
                I have previous experience in data visualization in Python, Android App development using Java, web development with HTML and CSS, C, and Assembly. I have experimented by creating websites, mobile apps, and interactive experiences. See more in my projects section!

                I am a current senior at Vassar College with a major in Computer Science and a correlate (minor) in Mathemathics. I recently studied abroad at the University of York, where I studied Interactive Media. 
                Outside of class, I am a current president of Coalesce Dance Ensemble, a collabortive, audition-based dance organization as well as the co-chair of the Computer Science Major's Committee. I was a Quadball (formerly Quidditch) captain and the Treasurer of Coalesce Dance Ensemble. I was also a Daisy Chain where I helped raise money and plan events for seniors during my sophmore year. During my junior year fall, I was the assistant Event Manager for the Computer Science Major's Committee. I have also worked at Vassar College's Reunion, where I faciltated alumni relations. I additionally was an orientation leader where I led a homeroom for a group of 20 first-year students. In this homeroom, I faciltated presentations on tough subjects, like consent, overdose prevention, and wellness.
