        <main>
            <p> I am a current junior at Vassar College with a major in Computer Science and a correlate (minor) in Mathemathics. Currently, I am studying abroad at University of York, where I am studying Interactive Media. 
                Outside of class, I was a Quadball (formerly Quidditch) captain and the Treasurer and President of Coalesce Dance Ensemble. I was also a Daisy Chain where I helped raise money and plan events for seniors during my sophmore year. During my junior year fall, I was the assistant Event Manager for the Computer Science Major's Committee. </p>

                <p> Overall, I really enjoy exploring the intersection of the arts and computer science. I have previous experience in data visualization in Python, Android App development using Java, web development with HTML and CSS, C, and Assembly. I also have past experience working in Unity, creating a virtual experience for the Vive headset. I am always willing to learn and explore new technologies! </p>
