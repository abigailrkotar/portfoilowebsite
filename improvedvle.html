            <h2 class="title">Improved Yorkshare VLE Project</h2>
            <p>With Joseph Hutchinson, Taylor Angel, and Tina Yao at the University of York, my groupmates and I were tasked with researching and improving an online learning tool. To do so, we conducted ethical user research through a survery and semi-structured interviews.</p>
            <p>From those results, we decided to focus on the University of York's VLE, or virtual learning environment, as the most users commented on it. We then created personas and a user experience map based off of our data.</p>
            <p>Finally, we created wireframes and then a final high-fiedlity prototype in Figma.</p>

            <h3 class="title">UX Research</h3>
            <p>As a group, we wanted to target issues within the current virtual learning environemnts that students use. We tried to make little assumptions about what users actually wanted and used our survey as a way to have users express how they felt about certain tools. </p>

            <img src="images/currently_has.png" alt="histogram that displays what features students have on a virtual learning environment. A few number of students have their timetables on their VLE." width="750">

            <p>We noticed a disparity from the results above, showing that most students wanted featured like a built-in timetable. We decided to focus on renovating the Yorkshare VLE, the tool that University of York students use, as a majority of our responses were from York students.</p>
            <p>We then conducted the semi-structured interviews which allowed us to dive deeper into how students felt about the VLE and what problems they faced. </p>

            <h3 class="title">Personas and Journeys</h3>
            <p>Based on our user research we created a primary and secondary persona that reflected the population we were targetting. We were targetting students, but also teacher assistants and graduate students who would be on both ends of the platform. </p>

            <p>Inspired by Lego's user journey map, we created a similar map showcasing a user's struggles and how new features could fix these pain points.</p>
