            <p>With a group at the University of York, my groupmates and I were tasked with researching and improving an online learning tool. To do so, we conducted ethical user research through a survery and semi-structured interviews.</p>
            <p>From those results, we decided to focus on the University of York's VLE, or virtual learning environment, as the most users commented on it. We then created personas and a user experience map based off of our data.</p>
            <p>Finally, we created wireframes and then a final high-fiedlity prototype in Figma.</p>
