            <h3>Summary </h3>
            <p><em>September 2022 - Present </em></p>
            <p> Made in collaboration with Emily Granville.</p>
            <p> In Java, created a story-telling role-playing game for Android. The game features an interactive story where different choices lead to different endings. Each ending is unlocked by gaining approval with different non-player controlled characters. I mainly focused on implementing character customization and coins. The user can customize their own character by selecting different radio buttons. If the user gains enough approval with certain NPCs, they can also customize those NPCs. In addition, coins are given to a player for logging in every 24 hours as well as for completeing a chapter for the first time. </p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>We used an agile approach to make the game through 5 different iterations. We started with an inception phase. We focused on creating use cases, an iteration plan, and a vision statement using Markdown. </p>
            <p>For our first real iteration, we worked on creating the game as a text-based application in Java. We implemented all of the basic functionalities, like character customization and playable chapters. </p>

            <p>Above is an example of the text-based version of the game.</p>

            <p>The third iteration consisted of transitioning for text-based to a real Android application. We employed Model-View-Controller to make this transition easier. The model changed from a text UI to a graphical UI but the main source code was able to remain the same.</p>
            <p>The fourth iteration was a mostly completed Android application. We added state-preservation.</p>
            <!--inset images here-->
            <p>In the fifth and final iteration (for now), we uploaded the application to the appstore. We also added a feature where users earned coins every 24 hours. </p>
