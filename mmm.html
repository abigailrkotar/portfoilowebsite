                <p> Made in collaboration with Emily Granville.</p>
                <p> In Java, created a story-telling role-playing game for Android. The game features an interactive story where different choices lead to different endings. Each ending is unlocked by gaining approval with different non-player controlled characters. I mainly focused on implementing character customization and coins. The user can customize their own character by selecting different radio buttons. If the user gains enough approval with certain NPCs, they can also customize those NPCs. In addition, coins are given to a player for logging in every 24 hours as well as for completeing a chapter for the first time. </p>
