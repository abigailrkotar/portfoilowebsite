            <h2 class="title">My Closet Project</h2>
            <p>For my web development course at University of York, we were tasked with creating an interactive website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I created "My Closet," a fashionista's heaven.</p>
            <p>The user can take the style quiz, which recommends user's new items to add to their closets. Then, the user can upload pictures of their own clothing items to style and save outfits! Outfits and uploaded images are saved using JSON and local storage.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Inspiration</h3>

                width="300">
            <p>Based on other apps, like Stylebook or Polyvore, I wanted to create a website that acted like an extension of ones closet. Additionally, I wanted to recommend user's different pieces that might suit their style. I added the style quiz on the inital page of the website to engage users and also recommend them clothes based on their style. </p>

            <h3 class="title">Inital Sketch</h3>
            <p>I created my inital sketch by simply drawing it out on my iPad. At this point, I had wanted a login screen and to save user's names.</p>

                width="500">

            <p>However, I did some brief research and realized many users might be barred from using a website with a login page, or one that seems to take their information for no reason. Therefore, I decided to only save the results of their style quiz, as these resutls did not need to be associated with a profile.</p>
