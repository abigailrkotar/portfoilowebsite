        <h2 class="title">Problem</h2>
        <p>After visiting the National Railway Museum in York, I was tasked with making the museum more interactive. The museum features incredible trains, but there is little movement or information on the trains. </p>
        <h2 class="title">Research</h2>
        <p>The National Railway Museum provided us access to their data from their survey. While reviewing this data, there were a few common trends I noticed.</p>
        <img src="images/customer_response.png" alt="Improvement: would love to do a treasure type hunt. May be something special about the trains that everyone could get involved that takes you around the whole site." width="1000">
        <p>As seen above, this user requests a treasure hunt along with other vistors who requested a more interactive experience for all ages. During my visit, I started playing Pokemon Go, which inspired me to create an Augmented Reality based mobile application that acts like a treasure-hunt through all the trains.</p>

        <h2 class="title">User Journey</h2>
        <p>Based on the National Railway Museum's data and their focus on accessibility and inclusion, I created two personas. </p>
        <img src="images/persona1.png" alt="user persona of Hugh, who is a young boy in a wheelchair. he loves trains and cannot wait to visit the National Railway Museum." width=50%>
        <img src="images/persona2.png" alt="user persona of Gloria, who is a middle age mom who wants to enjoy a fun experience for the whole family" width=50%>
        <p>My primary persona is Hugh, who is a train lover! He cannot climb into old trains due to his wheelchair but craves a way to interact with the trains.</p>
